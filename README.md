# LeadInWater
An Analysis of lead content measured in ppb collected from tap water samples around Toronto.

Data was taken from the Toronto Open Data Portal: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/non-regulated-lead-sample/

The final output is a dashboard which shows the top 15 partial postal codes in Toronto which contain the highest overall average of lead content measured in parts per billion. Along with a line graph depicting a reference line which shows the maximum amount of lead that can be in water for it to still be considered "healthy". The user can choose the first three letters of their postal code to see how their neighbourhood compares to the threshold limit.
